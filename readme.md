<h1>C# WebSocket Server</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>C# WebSocket Server is a easy and user-friendly Listen server for WebSocket clients written in Microsoft’s C# language. 
The code itself is located in 3 class files - Server.cs, Client.cs and Helpers.cs. 
A listen server is easily created by simply creating a new Server object. After the object is created, 
you will have to bind the events that the server object has where you choose what to do with the data. </p>
